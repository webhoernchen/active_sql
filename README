ActiveSql
=========

ActiveSql is a libary to write complicated sql conditions in Ruby syntax.

Example
=======

class Seminar < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :events, :class_name => 'SeminarEvent'
end

class SeminarEvent < ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :seminar
  has_and_belongs_to_many :participants, :class_name => 'User'
end

class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_and_belongs_to_many :seminar_events
end

We want to find all Seminars with an Event in 3 weeks and a participant which name starts with 'Max'.

Seminar.by_active_sql_condition_scope do |seminar|
  seminar.events do |event|
    event.start_date >= 3.weeks.from_now.to_date
    event.participants do |participant|
      participant.name.starts_with 'Max'
    end
  end
end.all


We want to sort all seminars by last the last event.

Seminar.by_active_sql_order_scope do |seminar|
  seminar.max {|s| s.events.start_date }
end

You can find more examples, condition and sort methods in the specific classes:
 * ActiveSql::Condition
 * ActiveSql::Finder
 * ActiveSql::SortCondition


Tested with:
------------

* Rails 2.3.15
* Rails 3.0.19


Thats all!
